- _Prefer done right, right now, over done yesterday. The "done yesterday" mindset is opposed to "still works tomorrow"._  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;– Me, on my resume
- JS expert, HTML & CSS proficient. Framework of choice React. Strives to make ethical and user-centric design decisions, from speed to A11y
- ECMAScript proposal watcher, excited for the pipeline operator and optional chaining + nullish coalescing. Ride the wave of JS progress!
- Generally borrows heavily from the functional paradigm, prefers declarative APIs (internally), and loves formulating robust data-driven control-flow  
- Environment of choice is VS Code and command line tools. Most at home with Linux or Posix (macOS) systems.
- Git and GitHub fan, with years of experience using and helping others to learn the tool & service
